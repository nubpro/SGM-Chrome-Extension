## Contributing

Please base your work around an issue. If you're working on a feature that has no enhancement issue open for it, please create one.

To begin, create a fork of our repo and then create a branch for the issue you are working on (`label-number`, ex: `bug-1` `enhancement-2`). Let people know you are working on it by placing a comment on the issue. Commit your code to that branch.

When complete, open a pull request for your issue branch to our dev branch.

## Guidelines

Do not iterate the version in your work.
